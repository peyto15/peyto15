- 👋 Hi, I’m Peyton! 
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud engineering, gaming, and computer hardware (personal or enterprise).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to architect cloud systems, raise a few kiddos, and take better care of my lawn. 
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on anything under the sun that gets me excited. Most of my coding/dev background is in Python and Ansible though. 
- 📫 You can find my LinkedIn profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/prfane. Feel free to send me a message anytime!
